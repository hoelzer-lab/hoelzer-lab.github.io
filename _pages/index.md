We apply our computational methods to de novo genome assembly, cancer genomics and (most recently) infectious disease. We collaborate closely with [Nick Loman's group at the University of Birmingham](http://lab.loman.net/), [Winston Timp's lab at Johns Hopkins University](http://www.timplab.org/) and [Conrad Nieduszynski at the University of Oxford](http://www.path.ox.ac.uk/content/conrad-nieduszynski).
