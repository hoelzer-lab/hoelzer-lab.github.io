# A paper per day

To succeed in science, reading is of paramount importance. However, I always
lack the time (or I find other excuses) to read all the interesting sounding
manuscripts I stumble across every day on Twitter or bioRxiv. Inspired by a
tweet of
@[BeAScientist](https://twitter.com/BeAScientist/status/1136657979317448705) I
will challenge myself to read _a scientific paper per (work)day_. 

I'm trying to update this list to 1) keep track of myself, 2) provide some
[TL;DR](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tl%3Bdr) notes for the
impatient and for me to rember, and 3) perhaps inspire others to do the same and
to join the _a paper per day_ challenge.

* EBI Metagenomics: one of the worlds largest metagenomic data repository
* the paper presents updates from the last 2 years (~2015-2017) to the service, [MGnify](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/)
* analyis and archive sequencing data from microbial environments
* new: taxonomic assignment by 16S and 23S rRNA assignments using Infernal and Rfam
* also new: metagenomic assembly (w metaSPAdes, MEGAHIT and Minia) upon request --> 50mio non-redundant protein sequences
    * selection of optimal assembly pipeline using a neural network
* metagenome analysis problems
    * need high computational power
    * different tools/pipelines --> hard to compare results
* majority of data is 16S rRNA amplicons, followed by WGS
* improved search interface

    * R/F-PKM are biased when comparing multiple samples

* bats are longest-lived mammals
* 8-year study of ageing in _Myotis myotis_
* 150 blood samples, RNA-Seq
* also compared with ~300 longitudinal RNA-Seq samples of other mammals (human, mouse, wolf)
* bats show a unique age-related gene expression
* partial regulated by miRNAs
* _Myotis_ maintain length of telomeres with age without developing cancer
* like humans, 75% of the transcriptional output derived from the top 100 expressed transcripts (enriched DNA repair!)
* _Myotis_ might have evolved an elaborate DNA repair machinery and a distinct immune system (no increased inflammation in age)
* genome maintenance and cell cycle regulation down-regulated in the other mammals, not in bats
* GenAge database, 207 human ageing-associated genes
* M&Ms
    * rRNA- and smallRNA-Seq Illumina
    * 50mill reads, 2x 125bp
    * 8mill reads, 1x 50bp for small
    * 100 transcriptomes, 50 miRNomes from 150 blood samples
    * TopHat, Cufflinks, ...
    * Metascape for functional enrichment analysis
    * miRNA-mRNA interaction analysis: ExUTR, miRanda

* genome-resolved metagenomic data analysis
* [MetaWRAP](https://github.com/bxlab/metaWRAP)
* extract individual draft genomes (bins)
* from raw reads to metagenomic bins
* binning: often clustering togehter similar scaffolds e.g. by _k_-mer, codon usage, and similar coverage
* highly modular, each modul is a shell script
* custom python2.7 scripts
* conda, docker
* database download guide
* reassemble_bins module (map reads to bins and assemble again with SPAdes instead of metaSPAdes/MegaHit); highly improves bin quality
    * The Reassemble_bins module improved upon 78%, 98%, and 2% of the bins in the water, gut, and soil bin sets, respectively.
    * soil is so diverse, that the re-assembly step confuses
    * own idea: integrate long reads in the re-assembly step
* metagenomic binning software: MaxBin2, metaBAT2, CONCOCT
* test data: water, gut, soil
    * water samples were dominated by _Proteobacteria_
* Bin_refinement module produced 235, 175, and 134 acceptable quality bins in the water, gut, and soil samples
